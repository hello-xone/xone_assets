## Additional Information

### Please note:

- **Brand new tokens and new tools are not accepted.**
- Projects must be sound, with available information and **non-minimal circulation**.

### Assets App

The Assets web app can be used for most new token additions (GitHub account is needed).

### Quick starter

_You can also use scripts below to help with token submission and validation._

### Validation Script

Before submitting your token, you can validate all `info.json` files using the provided validation script:

```bash
bash validate_info_json.sh
```

This script will:

- Scan all `info.json` files in `blockchains/xone` and `blockchains/xone_testnet` directories
- Validate that all required fields in "Basic_Information" are present and have non-empty values
- Check for unexpected fields or sections not in the standard format
- Report any validation errors

**Requirements:**

- The script requires `jq` to be installed on your system
- All fields in "Basic_Information" must be present and have non-empty values
- "Social_Profiles" and "Price_Data" sections are optional, but if present, should only contain the allowed fields

## About display

The token information, tools and DApps information of this repository will be displayed in the following projects because they rely on the relevant information of this repository as the display source.

- [Xone official website](https://xone.org)
- [Xone Scan](https://xonescan.com)

## Scripts

There are several scripts available for maintainers:

- `make check` -- Execute validation checks; also used in continuous integration.
- `make fix` -- Perform automatic fixes where possible
- `make update-auto` -- Run automatic updates from external sources, executed regularly (GitHub action)

## On Checks

This repo contains a set of scripts for verification of all the information. Implemented as Golang scripts, available through `make check`, and executed in CI build; checks the whole repo.

There are similar check logic implemented:

- in assets-management app; for checking changed token files in PRs, or when creating a PR. Checks diffs, can be run from browser environment.
- in merge-fee-bot, which runs as a GitHub app and shows result in PR comment. Executes in a non-browser environment.

## Disclaimer

Xone team allows anyone to submit new assets to this repository. However, this does not mean that we are in direct partnership with all of the projects.

Xone team will reject projects that are deemed as scam or fraudulent after careful review.
Xone team reserves the right to change the terms of asset submissions at any time due to changing market conditions, risk of fraud, or any other factors we deem relevant.
