    "description": "IRO is the governance and value-capture token of the IRO ecosystem. Its value is driven by the platform’s real-world cash flow through a three-pronged mechanism: Staking: Stake IRO to receive cash flow distributions denominated in USDT/USDX. Buyback and Burn: A portion of the platform’s net revenue is used to buy back and burn IRO, creating scarcity and price elasticity. Governance and Utility: IRO grants governance rights and scenario-based benefits (e.g., allocation for IRO launchpad offerings, fee discounts, VIP/NFT privileges, etc.).",
